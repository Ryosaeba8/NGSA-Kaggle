## Features extraction
Missing link prediction using :
- node2vec embeddings
- features ectracted from the underlying structure of the graph 
- features extracted from the informations on the nodes

## Models
We trained machine learning algorithms such as 
- Logistic regression
- Support Vector Machine
- XGBOOST
- Neural Network
